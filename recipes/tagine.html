    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Tagine is a traditional Moroccan dish of chicken braised with a blend of spices. This variation adds caramelized pears for extra sweetness.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 onions, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh ginger root, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 pears, cored and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until softened and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions into a tagine. Layer chicken pieces on top of onions.</li>
        <li>Combine turmeric, cumin, ground coriander, and salt in a small bowl;
            mix well with remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil.
        Spread spice mixture onto the chicken pieces. Add cinnamon pieces, bay leaves, ginger, and cilantro. 
        Pour in 1/2 cup of water and cover tagine with a lid.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 50 minutes.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat while chicken is cooking. Add sliced pear and honey and cook, while stirring, until honey has caramelized.</li>
        <li>Remove tagine from the oven and stir in caramelized pears. Return to the oven and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
